    "There has been a revenue decline for a Portuguese bank and they would like to know what actions to take. After investigation, they found out that the root cause is that their clients are not depositing as frequently as before. Knowing that term deposits allow banks to hold onto a deposit for a specific amount of time, so banks can invest in higher gain financial products to make a profit. In addition, banks also hold better chance to persuade term deposit clients into buying other products such as funds or insurance to further increase their revenues. As a result, the Portuguese bank would like to identify existing clients that have higher chance to subscribe for a term deposit and focus marketing efforts on such clients."

    "Your client is a retail banking institution. Term deposits are a major source of income for a bank. A term deposit is a cash investment held at a financial institution. Your money is invested for an agreed rate of interest over a fixed amount of time, or term. The bank has various outreach plans to sell term deposits to their customers such as email marketing, advertisements, telephonic marketing and digital marketing. Telephonic marketing campaigns still remain one of the most effective way to reach out to people. However, they require huge investment as large call centers are hired to actually execute these campaigns. Hence, it is crucial to identify the customers most likely to convert beforehand so that they can be specifically targeted via call. You are provided with the client data such as : age of the client, their job type, their marital status, etc. Along with the client data, you are also provided with the information of the call such as the duration of the call, day and month of the call, etc. Given this information, your task is to predict if the client will subscribe to term deposit."

    "Contact Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "'contact' (contact method) has a relatively strong negative correlation with 'ID' (-0.734588) and 'default' (credit default), indicating that these features are somewhat related. This might suggest that certain contact methods are preferred or more effective for specific client profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous Marketing Campaigns:\n",
    "\n",
    "'pdays' (number of days since the last contact) has strong positive correlations with 'previous' (number of previous contacts) and 'poutcome' (outcome of the previous marketing campaign).

    "'month' and 'day' don't have strong correlations with most other features or the target variable, except for a moderate positive correlation between 'month' and 'poutcome' (0.040108). This might indicate some seasonality or temporal patterns in campaign outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Campaign-Related Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "'campaign' (number of contacts during this campaign) and 'poutcome' show some negative correlation (-0.086074), suggesting that more contacts in the current campaign may lead to a less favorable outcome if the previous campaign didn't succeed.\n",
    "Balance:\n",
